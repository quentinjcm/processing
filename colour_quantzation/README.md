# Colour Quantization

This sketch demos some colour quantization algorithms I have been exploring. Currently only using the median cut algorithm but I want to try some octree algorithms too.

Some interesting sorting references:

## Median Cut 

A collection of references I was looking at when implementing the median cut algorithm:

* [quick sort description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [quick sort algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/)
* [median cut description, a little hard to follow but it did the job](http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/science/rpn/biblio/ddj/Website/articles/DDJ/1994/9409/9409e/9409e.htm)
